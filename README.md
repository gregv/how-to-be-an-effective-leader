# How to be an effective leader
_Thoughts on effective leadership that I've collected over the years_

# Foreword
I try to be the best person that I can be - daily.  
I am not good at everything, in fact, I can only claim to be an expert eater of food and drinker of coffee and beer.

This is meant to be a unique and raw perspective on leadership.  It is crafted after both observing leaders that I admire, and trying to replicate that for myself.  I tried my best to write something that you've hopefully never read anywhere else.

# Make, Teach, Learn
_In that order, every day._

**Managers** are transportation mediums for direction.  
**Leaders** realize direction into outcomes into results.

Make things that illustrate your vision. Make things that help you practice your craft.  Make things to show you can literally
create value.  Make things to encourage others.  Make things to fail. Make things to learn. 

Teach things that fill gaps for your team.  Get others to teach things to you that fill your gaps.  
Teach to validate your learning.  Teach things to practice your communication (of technical concepts).

Learn technology trends and what is new on the [tech radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).  Learn about how to be a
better boss from other people by observing them.  Record yourself presenting, learn from your own feedback.
Survey your team and learn from their feedback, learn from peer feedback, learn from self-reflection.
Learn how you best learn specific things (e.g. Udemy, YouTube, TED Talks, hackathons, books, podcasts, MeetUps).
Make and teach things to prove you have learned. "Taking a class" without an outcome is not learning.

# Dos and Don'ts
- Do not recommend podcasts, do recommend specific podcast episodes and the outcome you received that you think 
others would benefit from.  Quote the podcast directly.
- Do not continue to have unproductive meetings.  Do not have status meetings.
Do ensure that every _single_ person in a meeting should either be receiving value or providing value.
- Do not have watercooler chats on Slack, these take away from productivity.  
Do limit your "feel good" Slack channels and favor 1:1 conversations.  
Do `/leave` Slack channels that waste your time by distracting you that are not providing value.

# Slack
When you use `@channel` you are disrupting people's lives.  If you really need to do that, you had better have a good reason.

# Efficiency
You owe it to your company and everyone involved to call out people who don't bring a clear purpose and outcome to a meeting.

If you want to get serious, use a combination of [speaker diarization](https://github.com/aalto-speech/speaker-diarization) 
and [loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) to record meetings so that you can verify all invitees are speaking.

People talk more than others.  Keep verbose speakers from taking over meetings by allocating time.  
Use [termdown](https://github.com/trehn/termdown) to allocate time and stick with your allocations.  
Use [parking lots](http://www.agile-ux.com/2010/12/16/parking-lot-a-good-facilitation-tool/) 
and action items to follow-up with discussion outside of your meetings.  Allocate times to sprint demos and standup until
you no longer need to strictly measure time.


# People
_"You were born with two ears and one mouth for a reason‚Äù 55 AD from Epictetus_
Ask questions, but don't ask meaningless questions - ask with intent.  Are you refining your perspective? 
Seek first to understand.

Get into the details of what your team does to understand strengths and opportunities.  Do not rely on hear-say, but
value 360 feedback.  Managers who praise unchallenging and non-technical outcomes look bad when technical people realize
that work was not challenging.  
Calibrate your understanding of technical challenges by asking questions and reviewing documentation.  Be able to accurately
and intelligently speak about what your team has done and the work it plans to do.

Surprise your team - do things for your team that are boring and let them know that you took care of it.  The last
thing people want is mundane and meaningless work.  If you cannot eliminate it, _trade off_ in taking the share of burden
from your team.  This shows that you care and that you are also competent in handling some of the work.  

# Focus
People love responsive replies.  It makes them feel like you care about them.  Always respond to emails with value
and never only respond with "thank you".  When you provide meaningful communication it may mean that you stop sending emails and
may mean that your team has less distractions.

Instead of sending an email, determine what the right course of action should be:
1. Pin something to a Slack channel
2. Update documentation
3. Create a User Story/Bug
4. Add a calendar reminder



# Strategy
Prototype - buy down risk for the future and prove that something can be done.  How do you know if something is able to be
implemented?  Learn the minimum amount of technology that you need to prototype what you're looking for.  Provide a north-star
by creating a dimmer version of that star.

Wait - I need to write code to be an effective manager? 
Yes. If you have "software engineer" in your "software engineering manager" title, you need to write code.  
You won't sling as much code as a software engineer, but you need to show that you are competent in your role by being
a model for your team to follow.  If you aren't in software engineering, you still need to create things as part of your job.
These creations may not hold a candle to someone more technical on your team who is executing, without meetings, daily.

Mockup your vision.  You need to put in due diligence for your ideas and direction.  You cannot expect a sentence to describe
everything you're looking for.  Create diagrams, photoshop a mockup, provide example output - do everything you can
to fight the fact that humans are not good communicators, especially of technical content.  If you can't prototype, illustrate.


# Innovation
Every company wants to innovate, create innovative things, attract and retain people who want to do innovative stuff.  The truth is that you can't always be doing crazy and amazing things.

What is innovation?  Look at this in terms of outcomes to answer this question.
1. Patents - amazingly unique ideas that no one has thought about
2. Products - trailblazing apps that people love to use and/or are backed by crazy innovative technology
3. Process - the opposite of doing the same thing for 5 years

When you define innovation for your company or team - how are you defining it?  The way you answer this question determines how you drive down the innovation road.


Block out time for your team to have an opportunity to do something completely nuts...once or twice a year.  Encourage them to build creative things during their work week - every. single. day.  Don't delay people from fixing a broken process, prototype a better product, or experimenting to confirm to kill a product (from [HBR Ideacast: Episode 664](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7mXMOVn1883bFU4oPPR2Fa?si=kFdKiNkURR-G04WCbe3avw)).

Create an open culture - be both a leader and a follower - you don't have better ideas than anyone else, you need to get them out of everyone else by asking refining questions, getting more into the weeds, make sure that every voice is heard.

Include the right people - diversity is always a great idea: you need people with different viewpoints and backgrounds before you start anything (see WorkLife with Adam Grant - [The Daily Show's Secret to Creativity](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2CqhiW4559IbRPp4nJOuyk?si=ZLOrplfDR06gWVypyMWvfQ)).  You need to find (or create) tenacity around experimentation and diversity of thoughts.  Look for people who have voluminous ideas and also like to tinker with those ideas.  From the saying "don't mistake action for accomplishment" - don't mistake ideas for action.  A good balance of putting ideas into action is what you want to encourage.  People have to _want to be innovative_ and need _time to be innovative_.

Focus on topics - free brainstorming creates breadth, but doesn't get anything done.  The ultimate trade-off from innovation is warm and fuzzy ideas and getting things done.  Sure, take time to brainstorm, but brainstorming by itself is not innovation.  Funnel brainstorms into documentation, refine those thoughts, use a lean canvas to put a dollar amount on the idea, experiment, deliver.  Focus on themes and topics, your job as a leader is to distill down the company's challenges and mission into themes for the team to feed from.

Never, ever, ever, ever - ask for a blanket of "innovative ideas".  Innovative ideas come as a result of focus on a problem.  Work to define problems, and encourage innovative ideas around those specific things.  If you get an email that asks you to populate "innovative productivity-related ideas" - don't just forward this to your team.  Add your perspective, your problem statements, then ask the team to think about those or introduce their own.  Seed brainstorms, water them too - don't just throw things out and hope they stick.  See `Surprise your team` above.

Encourage deep education in weak team areas - it's hard to come up with innovative ideas that aren't specific.  Answering the "how" of a problem is almost as important as the "why".  From a patentability standpoint, you need to dive into details to be considered by the USPTO.  

Obtain or learn breadth - You need to know a little about a lot.  The more broadly you, or an aggregation of your team knows, the more you'll avoid wasting time building things that already exist.  Always try to tie innovation to existing teams and products.  Use Slack search, Confluence search, even Google search - read about what other teams are working on.  You rarely need to start a project with little knowledge - take some time to understand the landscape around you.
