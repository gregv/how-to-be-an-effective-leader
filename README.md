# How to be an effective leader
_Thoughts on effective leadership that I've collected over the years_

# Foreword
I try to be the best person that I can be - daily.  
I am not good at everything, in fact, I can only claim to be an expert eater of food and drinker of coffee and beer.

# Make, Teach, Learn
_In that order, every day._
Managers are transportation mediums for direction.  Leaders realize direction into outcomes into results.
Make things that illustrate your vision. Make things that help you practice your craft.  Make things to show you can literally
create value.  Make things to encourage others.  Make things to fail. Make things to learn. 

Teach things that fill gaps for your team.  Get others to teach things to you that fill your gaps.  
Teach to validate your learning.  Teach things to practice your communication (of technical concepts).

Learn technology trends and what is new on the [tech radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).  Learn about how to be a
better boss from other people by observing them.  Record yourself presenting, learn from your own feedback.
Survey your team and learn from their feedback, learn from peer feedback, learn from self-reflection.
Learn how you best learn specific things (e.g. Udemy, YouTube, TED Talks, hackathons, books, podcasts, MeetUps).
Make and teach things to prove you have learned. "Taking a class" without an outcome is not learning.

# Dos and Don'ts
- Do not recommend podcasts, do recommend specific podcast episodes and the outcome you received that you think 
others would benefit from.  Quote the podcast directly.
- Do not continue to have unproductive meetings.  Do not have status meetings.
Do ensure that every _single_ person in a meeting should either be receiving value or providing value.
- Do not have watercooler chats on Slack, these take away from productivity.  
Do limit your "feel good" Slack channels and favor 1:1 conversations.  
Do `/leave` Slack channels that waste your time by distracting you that are not providing value.

# Slack
When you use `@channel` you are disrupting people's lives.  If you really need to do that, you had better have a good reason.

# Efficiency
You owe it to your company and everyone involved to call out people who don't bring a clear purpose and outcome to a meeting.

If you want to get serious, use a combination of [speaker diarization](https://github.com/aalto-speech/speaker-diarization) 
and [loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/) to record meetings so that you can verify all invitees are speaking.

People talk more than others.  Keep verbose speakers from taking over meetings by allocating time.  
Use [termdown](https://github.com/trehn/termdown) to allocate time and stick with your allocations.  
Use [parking lots](http://www.agile-ux.com/2010/12/16/parking-lot-a-good-facilitation-tool/) 
and action items to follow-up with discussion outside of your meetings.  Allocate times to sprint demos and standup until
you no longer need to strictly measure time.

Ask questions, but don't ask meaningless questions - ask with intent.  Are you refining your perspective? 
Seek first to understand.

Get into the details of what your team does to understand strengths and opportunities.  Do not rely on hear-say, but
value 360 feedback.  Managers who praise unchallenging and non-technical outcomes look bad when technical people realize
that work was not challenging.  
Calibrate your understanding of technical challenges by asking questions and reviewing documentation.  Be able to accurately
and intelligently speak about what your team has done and the work it plans to do.

Surprise your team - do things for your team that are boring and let them know that you took care of it.  The last
thing people want is mundane and meaningless work.  If you cannot eliminate it, trade of in taking the share of burden
from your team.  This shows that you care and that you are also competent in handling some of the work.

# Focus
People love responsive replies.  It makes them feel like you care about them.  Always respond to emails with value
and never only respond with "thank you".  When you provide meaningful communication it may mean that you stop sending emails and
may mean that your team has less distractions.



# Strategy
Prototype - buy down risk for the future and prove that something can be done.  How do you know if something is able to be
implemented?  Learn the minimum amount of technology that you need to prototype what you're looking for.  Provide a north-star
by creating a dimmer version of that star.

Wait - I need to write code to be an effective manager? 
Yes. If you have "software engineer" in your "software engineering manager" title, you need to write code.  
You won't sling as much code as a software engineer, but you need to show that you are competent in your role by being
a model for your team to follow.  If you aren't in software engineering, you still need to create things as part of your job.
These creations may not hold a candle to someone more technical on your team who is executing, without meetings, daily.

Mockup your vision.  You need to put in due diligence for your ideas and direction.  You cannot expect a sentence to describe
everything you're looking for.  Create diagrams, photoshop a mockup, provide example output - do everything you can
to fight the fact that humans are not good communicators, especially of technical content.  If you can't prototype, illustrate.
